    <h1 id="mapping-stance-of-climate-change-tweets">Mapping stance of climate change tweets</h1>
    <p>The following is a visualisation of the stance of tweets about man-made climate change.</p>
    <p><em>What is climate change stance?</em></p>
    <p>We simplify stance by talking about two stances one can have regarding man-made, or human-caused, climate
        change:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Favor: believes in man-made climate change</li>
        <li>Against: does not believe in man-made climate change</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Of course there are more elaborate classifications, but for the sake of this visualisation, we the goal was to
        visualise the question:</p>
    <p><em>How many tweets on Twitter deny man-made climate change?</em></p>
    <h2 id="data">Data</h2>
    <p>We collected all the tweets containing the words 'climate' and 'change' from the <a
            href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/consuming-streaming-data">Twitter Streaming API</a>
        over the course of one month (March 5th until April 5th 2020). Tweets were collected live on a Raspberry Pi and
        stored in a database. For each tweet, when there was no geolocation available (only ~1% of tweets are
        geotagged), we inferred its location based on the text that each Twitter user put on their profile. This allowed
        us to add location data to 50% of tweets.</p>
    <h3 id="stance">Stance</h3>
    <p>We trained a stance classification model on a dataset of approx. 50,000 tweets labelled with their stance on
        man-made climate change (<a href="http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/index.php?id=data-and-tools">link</a>).
        Our RNN model (<a href="https://docs.fast.ai/text.models.html#AWD_LSTM">link</a>) achieves an accuracy of about
        80% on our test dataset. This can, and should, certainly be
        improved, and the resulting visualisation is NOT perfectly accurate with regards to the classified stance. View
        it as correctly showing the rough trend for now.</p>
    <h3 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h3>
    <p>The map shows ~400,000 tweets, binned into the states of a country (some tweets were removed because there was
        only information about the country of origin), aggregated per day. All bubbles are scaled by the square root of
        the 99.9%-th quantile to make
        the visualisation useful for countries where there aren't many tweets. Favor/against
        scaling is preserved through the square root.</p>
    <h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>
    <p>This visualisation should be viewed as an interesting exploration of stance on climate change. The numbers are
        not perfectly accurate, as the language models to correctly classify tweets are not flawless. The locations are
        not necessarily accurate either, as most tweets were not geotagged - the location is solely based on the users
        profile. The choice of representation (blue and red bubbles) is not ideal - for example, if there are almost as
        many 'against' tweets as there are 'favor' tweets, the bubble will appear almost completely red. A better choice
        are pie-charts, where area accurately represents percentage. We prototyped that visualisation, but making an
        interactive visualisation with this many datapoints was proving too difficult at this point.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2>
    <p>The map shows the world, with bubbles representing the number of tweets about climate change on the given date
        (blue: favor, red: against), at the given location. The line chart below shows the global number of tweets for
        the given dates.</p>
    <p>You can <strong><em>interact</em></strong> with the visualisation in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Press <strong><em>play</em></strong> to animate the number of tweets over the given timeline</li>
        <li><strong><em>Slide</em></strong> the date around to show the data for a given date</li>
        <li><strong><em>Hover</em></strong> over a bubble to reveal the exact numbers of tweets with stance favor
            (humans contribute significantly to climate change) and against (humans don't contribute to climate change),
            as well as the top 5 hashtags in that aggregation of tweets.
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>Zoom</em></strong> to reveal local changes - scroll into the map and drag it around!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This map was created using <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>. We updated the <a

            href="https://www.axismaps.com/blog/2014/10/geography-of-jobs-animated-mapping-with-d3/">Axis Maps</a> to D3
        version 5, and adapted parts of the line-chart from <a
